        <p>I am a computer science student who likes making websites. I am currently studying towards a bachelor's degree at 
            <a href="https://wou.edu/" target="_blank">Western Oregon University</a>. 
            My interests are on front end web development. A website needs to look appealing as well as functional. User experience and UI design is 
            one of the most critical aspects of a website.
        </p>

        <p>I have experience designing webpages with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Most of my projects recently have been developing websites and web 
            applications. I have a basic knowledge of Javascript and JQuery. I also have some experience developing full-stack applications, both web 
            and mobile.
